This task involves creating a C++ application that handles basic file input/output (I/O) operations: writing, reading, and appending data to text files using the fstream library. The core purpose is to enable persistent storage of data, which is a common requirement in many applications.

Including Libraries:
The program starts by including essential headers such as iostream for console I/O, fstream for file operations, and string to manage text data.

Writing Data:
Using an ofstream object, the application creates or overwrites a text file to store initial data. This is fundamental for saving new information or initializing the file.

Reading Data:
An ifstream object is used to open and read the file line by line. This step is crucial for retrieving stored data, allowing the program to process or display it as needed.

Appending Data:
To add new content without erasing existing data, the program employs an ofstream in append mode (std::ios::app). This lets users update the file dynamically by adding new lines of information.

Compilation and Execution:
The code is compiled using a C++ compiler to generate an executable file. Running this executable demonstrates the file operations by writing data to the file, reading the initial content, appending additional data, and then reading the updated file.

Applications:
Data Persistence:
Many applications require saving data between sessions. For instance, user preferences, game scores, or session logs can be stored in text files, making them accessible each time the application runs.

Logging Systems:
The ability to append data is especially useful in logging, where applications continuously record events, errors, or user actions. These logs help in troubleshooting and monitoring software behavior.

Configuration Files:
Programs often read configuration settings from files at startup. This allows developers or users to change the program’s behavior without modifying the source code.

Educational Purposes:
This task is an excellent introduction to file handling in C++ for beginners. It demonstrates how to manage external data storage, a vital skill for many programming projects.

Simple Data Management:
In scenarios where a full-fledged database is unnecessary, text files offer a straightforward solution for storing and retrieving data in a human-readable format.

By mastering these steps, we’re learning a fundamental skill in programming that applies to a wide range of real-world applications—from simple note-taking programs to more complex logging systems.
